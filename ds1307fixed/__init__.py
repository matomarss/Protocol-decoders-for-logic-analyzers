'''
This decoder stacks on top of the 'i2c' PD and decodes the Dallas DS1307
real-time clock (RTC) specific registers and commands. This is a fixed version of this decoder capable of decoding
communication that starts with reading from registers without needing to specify the address of the register where the
reading starts. In this version, the decoder is also capable of visualizing that only some registers
were read from/written to.
